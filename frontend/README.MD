## Project Overview

FrameFlow is a modern video editing web application that allows users to:

- Upload videos and audio files.  
- Preview and interact with their media.  
- Use AI-powered chat commands to edit videos (e.g., trim clips, add captions, remove animations).  
- Access a timeline and editing tools for fine control.  

The frontend communicates with a FastAPI backend that handles transcription, video editing logic, and rendering.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/frameflow-frontend.git
cd frameflow-frontend
````

2. **Open in browser**

Since this is a static frontend, you can open HTML files directly in your browser:

```bash
open index.html
```

> Or you can use a local development server like `Live Server` in VS Code for hot reload.

3. **Connect to backend**

Make sure your **FastAPI backend** is running (default at `http://localhost:8000`) so the AI chat and video processing features work correctly.

---

## Usage

* **Landing / Hero Page**: Click “View Dashboard” to go to the Upload page.
* **Upload Page**: Drag & drop video/audio files into the drop zone or click “choose file.” After upload, click “Start Editing.”
* **Studio Page**:

  * Use the **Media Panel** to select sources.
  * Preview your video in the **Preview Panel**.
  * Use **Tool Buttons** to apply edits manually.
  * Use the **AI Chat Panel** to send natural language commands to the backend.
  * Manage clips using the **Timeline**.

---

## Technologies

* **HTML5** – Structure and layout
* **CSS3** – Styling and animations
* **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Interactivity and frontend logic
